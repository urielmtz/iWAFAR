Intelligent Wearable Ankle-Foot Assistive Robot

Set of functions for controlling a wearable soft ankle-foot robotic device. This robotic device provides assistance for drop-foot impairment during level-ground walking.
Recognition of walking activity, gait phases and gait events is performed by a Machine Learning method based on Dynamic Bayesian Networks.

This work is part of the EPSRC project titled "Wearable Soft Robotics for Independent Living".
